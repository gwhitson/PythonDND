# PythonDND

--WORK IN PROGRESS--
An interactive map for hosting DND sessions.

It will be up to the DM to find/create maps to use within the app,
it is currently set to start at your monitors native resolution.


Still working on architecting it a bit but at the moment I am 
planning on having there be multiple modes to switch between. Movement vs. attack
I may make it have combat/non-combat modes. Ill cross that bridge when I get there.
