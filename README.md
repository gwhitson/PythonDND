--WORK IN PROGRESS--
An interactive map for hosting DND sessions.

It will be up to the DM to find/create maps to use within the app,
it is currently set to start at your monitors native resolution.

The app has the idea of a campaign which will have a unique (to it)
list of entities, attacks, and encounters. Encounters within a given
campaign will have access to all of the same entitites and attacks
as the campaign, and allows encounter-specific options to be added as well.

Once starting the encounter, the map will display and allow the DM
to control all entities and actions available to the players.

TODO:
adjust targetting method
 - after selecting attack, you will click on however many entities 
   you are targetting. The plan is once this version is more complete,
   revisit the targetting on actions to allow for different targets
   (line, cone, etc.)
